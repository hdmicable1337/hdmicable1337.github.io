	<p>Nameful is some weird anthro probably-a-cat creature. His specific breed is unknown tho. (probably a british shorthair) He wasn't born from a mother or made in a lab or anything like that, he just randomly spawned. Nobody knows how it happened it just did. He also has regeneration abilities. If his whole arm was cut off, he'd just perfectly regrow it in an instant. And here comes the coolest part--he has seeds that can make clones of himself and every clone comes with their own seeds</p>
